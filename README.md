Estimating state-level public opinion with Multilevel Regression Modeling and Poststratification

This file calculates estimates of state-level public opinion on abortion and same-sex rights for three years (2000, 2004, 2008) with survey data from Pew. An in-depth explanation and validation of MRP estimates can be found at http://www.columbia.edu/~jrl2124/mrp2.pdf. 

Statistical analyses are run utilizing logit models to predict whether a same-sex rights/abortion policy exists in a state-year. Data on state policy at the yearly level was downloaded from the Institute for Public Policy and Social Research at Michigan State University (http://ippsr.msu.edu/public-policy/correlates-state-policy).
